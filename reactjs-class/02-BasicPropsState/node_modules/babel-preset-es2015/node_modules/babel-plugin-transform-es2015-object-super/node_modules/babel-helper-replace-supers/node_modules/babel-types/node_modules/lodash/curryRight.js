 * This method is like `_.curry` except that arguments are applied to `func`
 * in the manner of `_.partialRight` instead of `_.partial`.
 *
 * The `_.curryRight.placeholder` value, which defaults to `_` in monolithic
 * builds, may be used as a placeholder for provided arguments.
 *
 * **Note:** This method doesn't set the "length" property of curried functions.
